# World Generation

- The player could select the world size, depending on the pixel amount 
(there could be five size, which are the following:
1. tiny - 1024 pixels
2. small - 2048 pixels
3. medium - 4096 pixels
4. large - 8192 pixels
5. massive - 16384 pixels)

- Each world is random and unique from one another (the location of major establishments are different, and each pixel would be randomly generated each time)
