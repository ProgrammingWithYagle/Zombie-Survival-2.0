# Asset Guidelines

This document outlines best practices for preparing sprites and tiles for Zombie-Survival-2.0.

## Sprite Tile Size

- Use **64×64 pixel** tiles for most sprites.
- Keep every frame or object within a 64×64 pixel box.

## Spritesheet Layout

- Arrange sprites in a grid of uniform rows and columns.
- Reserve a small amount of empty space (1–2 pixels) between tiles to prevent bleeding when rendering.
- Keep consistent padding around the edges of the spritesheet as well.

Following these guidelines makes it easier to load graphics consistently and keeps animation frames aligned.
