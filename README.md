# Zombie-Survival-2.0
A zombie survival game that is a revamp of my unfinished Scratch project.

Everyone is welcome to contribute to this project.

Here is the general premise of the project:

- **Art:** 2D Pixel (Probably not generated by AI)
- **Code:** Can be written manually or with AI assistance
- **Language:** Mainly C++
- **Library:** SFML
- **Preferrable IDE** Visual Studio

## Prerequisites

Before building, make sure you have the following installed:

- A C++17 compatible compiler
- CMake 3.10 or newer
- [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) 2.5 or newer

## Building

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

## Running

After building, the executable will be placed inside the `build` directory. Run it with:

```bash
./ZombieSurvival
```
